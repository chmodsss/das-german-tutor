This application was a result of playing around with the integration of Python, Flask and Vercel.

The app internally uses GPT-3 from OpenAI's API (I have deployed with my key). So, please dont exhaust my monthly limit.

The purpose of the application is teach by conversation. The user chats in English and the Bot responds in German.

Viel Spaß!.
